Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of Swiggy restaurant data using PostgreSQL. The dataset encompasses a variety of restaurant details, such as names, cities, ratings, cuisines, and more. The project focuses on answering specific questions and drawing meaningful insights from the data.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a PostgreSQL database and consists of the following columns:

- restaurant_no
- restaurant_name
- city
- address
- rating
- cost_per_person
- cuisine
- restaurant_link
- menu_category
- item
- price
- veg_or_nonveg


### Questions Explored
In this project, we addressed several key questions, each offering unique insights into the Swiggy restaurant data. These questions include:

- How many restaurants have a rating greater than 4.5? 
- Which city has the highest number of restaurants?
- How many restaurants have the word "PIZZA" in their name?
- What is the most common cuisine among the restaurants in the dataset?
- What is the average rating of restaurants in each city?
- ......


### Getting Started

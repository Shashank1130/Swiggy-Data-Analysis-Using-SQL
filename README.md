# Swiggy-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL


## Swiggy Data Analysis
Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of Swiggy restaurant data using PostgreSQL. The dataset encompasses a variety of restaurant details, such as names, cities, ratings, cuisines, and more. The project focuses on answering specific questions and drawing meaningful insights from the data.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a PostgreSQL database and consists of the following columns:

restaurant_no
restaurant_name
city
address
rating
cost_per_person
cuisine
restaurant_link
menu_category
item
price
veg_or_nonveg


### Questions Explored
In this project, we addressed several key questions, each offering unique insights into the Swiggy restaurant data. These questions include:

How many restaurants have a rating greater than 4.5?
Which city has the highest number of restaurants?
How many restaurants have the word "PIZZA" in their name?
What is the most common cuisine among the restaurants in the dataset?
What is the average rating of restaurants in each city?
What is the highest price of an item under the 'RECOMMENDED' menu category for each restaurant?
Find the top 5 most expensive restaurants that offer cuisine other than Indian cuisine.
Find the restaurants with an average cost higher than the total average cost of all restaurants.
Retrieve the details of restaurants that share the same name but are located in different cities.
Which restaurant offers the most items in the 'MAIN COURSE' category?
List the names of vegetarian restaurants in alphabetical order.
Identify the restaurant with the lowest average item price.
Find the top 5 restaurants offering the highest number of menu categories.
Determine the restaurant providing the highest percentage of non-vegetarian food.


### Getting Started
